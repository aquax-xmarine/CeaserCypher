This Python script enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters by a specified number of positions, as chosen by the user. Users can opt to select a file for encryption/decryption or input the message directly. 

When the user chooses to encrypt/decrypt messages from a file, the content designated for encryption/decryption resides in a file called messages.txt, and the resulting encryption/decryption is stored in a file named results.txt.
